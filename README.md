## 🧩 Feature Breakdown
### 1. 🧑‍💼 User Management
Handles user registration, authentication (login/logout), and profile updates.  
Users can sign up as guests or hosts, manage their personal info, and access their dashboard securely.

---

### 2. 🏡 Property Management
Allows hosts to create, edit, and delete property listings.  
Each property includes key details like title, description, price, and location, helping guests find suitable accommodations.

---

### 3. 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates.  
Users can manage check-in/check-out, number of guests, and view their booking history.

---

### 4. 💳 Payment Processing
Manages payments for bookings with status tracking.  
This ensures secure and accurate transactions between guests and property owners.

---

### 5. 🌟 Review System
Allows guests to leave ratings and feedback after their stay.  
Helps maintain quality and trust across the platform by allowing future guests to read real reviews.

---

### 6. ⚡ API Access (REST & GraphQL)
Provides both RESTful and GraphQL API access for frontend integration.  
Developers can retrieve and modify data easily through flexible endpoints.

---

### 7. 🔐 Security & Permissions
Implements user authentication and access control.  
Ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like updating properties or booking.

---

### 8. 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment
Uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Docker for containerized deployment.  
This helps keep the project tested, up-to-date, and production-ready.


## 🔐 API Security
### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
We use Token and Session Authentication to verify user identity.  
Only logged-in users can access protected routes such as booking a property or editing their profile.

#### 2. Authorization
Different permissions are enforced based on user roles.  
For example, only hosts can create or manage their property listings, while guests can only book and review.

#### 3. Rate Limiting (Planned)
Limits the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a short period.  
Prevents abuse like spamming API endpoints or brute-force login attempts.

#### 4. Data Validation
All incoming data is validated using serializers.  
This prevents invalid or malicious data from being stored in the database.

#### 5. HTTPS (Deployment Stage)
Ensures all data between frontend and backend is encrypted.  
Essential for securing sensitive data like passwords and payments.

### Why Security Is Crucial

- 🧑‍💼 **User Data Protection**: Users trust the platform with personal information (emails, names, etc.).  
- 💳 **Payment Security**: Payments must be processed without leaks, tampering, or fraud.  
- 🏡 **Platform Integrity**: Ensures only verified users can make bookings or post listings.  
- 🚨 **Prevent Abuse**: Rate limiting and permission rules help stop bots, spam, and unauthorized access.



## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**.  
It is a process where code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed to staging or production environments.

### Why It's Important

- 🧪 **Test Automation**: Ensures code is always tested before being merged or deployed.
- 🚀 **Faster Releases**: Speeds up deployment by removing manual steps.
- 🔁 **Consistency**: Reduces human error by automating repetitive tasks.
- 👥 **Team Collaboration**: Allows teams to work together without breaking shared code.

### Tools We Will Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment when code is pushed to GitHub.
- **Docker**: Packages the app into containers so it runs the same everywhere (dev, test, prod).
- **Docker Hub** *(optional)*: Stores built images for production deployment.
- **Heroku / Render / Railway** *(or similar)*: For actual hosting and automatic deploys.

CI/CD is a crucial part of building professional-grade, scalable software systems.
